# Tic Tac Toe project from JetBrains Academy

### Description :
#### Stage 1/5:
Nowadays, this game is known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, 
sometimes the rules are different, but the meaning of the game remains the same. Below are the main rules 
that may be familiar to you since childhood.
Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field where the duel takes place. One of the players plays as 'X', 
and the other player is 'O'. 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.
The first player that writes 3 'X's or 3 'O's in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
#### Stage 2/5:
However, our game should show the field in an "intermediate" states too. Let's try to visualize different combinations 
that the user will determine from the input. It is also important to think about the interface and set boundaries for 
our field.

### Objectives
#### Stage 1/5:
Your first task in this project is to print any state of the field in the console output. Do not forget to show the moves for both players.
#### Stage 2/5:
In this stage, you should write a program that:

- Reads 9 symbols from the input and writes an appropriate 3x3 field. 
  Elements of the field can contain only 'X', 'O' and '_' symbols.
- Sets the field to a specific format, i.e. the field should start and end with ---------, 
  all lines in between should start and end with '|' symbol and everything in 
  the middle should be separated with a single space.
